## About project

Solo Final Project by Kiris (Kulkunya) Prayarach

## **Project Title:**

**Advanced Data Science for Global Food Supply Chains & Agentic AI Weather Alert System Prototype** (Beta version)

## **Business Intuitions:**

**‚ÄúAgriculture remains the cornerstone of human survival, yet the sector faces mounting challenges‚Äîfrom unpredictable yields and climate volatility to price instability, technological lag, and limited access to predictive tools and quality data. These constraints hinder the industry‚Äôs ability to ensure long-term food security.**

To address these complex and interrelated issues, I‚Äôve leveraged advanced data science methodologies and cutting-edge AI tools to develop a solution that translates technical knowledge into real-world impact. This innovation enables deeper analysis of global food supply imbalances, uncovering the root causes of shortages and surpluses while accounting for climate risks, market uncertainties, and the low adoption of smart agricultural technologies.

By bridging data science with AI-driven intelligence, the system delivers timely, mission-critical insights for policymakers, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders. It empowers more informed and resilient decision-making across the agricultural value chain in an era defined by global megatrends and systemic uncertainty.‚Äù (Human 70% & AI 30%)

## **Data Science and AI Work Objectives:**

### **I. End-to-End Predictive Modeling & Semantic Search Intelligence**

- Conducted comprehensive **data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to support effective storytelling and insight communication.
- Applied a combination of **traditional econometric models (e.g., OLS)** and **machine learning / deep learning approaches** to quantitatively forecast agricultural crop production across countries, alongside classification models enhanced with intuitive **UI widgets and feature sliders** to improve user experience and front-end interactivity.
- Innovated LLM-based Analysis using primary data and free-form data from social media, X(Tweets) for 100 tweets and implemented Sentiment Analysis, render Basic Bigram NLP, and Advanced GPT-2 NLP and observed the outcomes.
- Scaled the solution by integrating **RAG** techniques with chunking and external **API integration (TripAdvisor Restaurant Reviews)** to build a **high-performance semantic search system**.
- Conducted **A/B testing** between a baseline model (without RAG) and an enhanced RAG model, supported by **robust statistical evaluation** to benchmark the effectiveness of semantic search in information retrieval.
- Deployed the final search engine via a **Gradio-based interface**, enabling real-time, responsive, and context-aware query results for users‚Äîparticularly within the travel and food domains.

### **II. Deployment of Agentic AI for Proactive Weather & Agricultural Risk Alerts**

- Transforming Data Science into Practical Impact ‚Äî Leveraged AI-based weather forecasting to build an automated email alert system, enabling timely notifications for climate risks and supporting proactive decision-making in agricultural management.
- Designed and deployed a **Mini Agentic AI** solution that autonomously sends **real-time weather alerts** to global food management authorities, supporting 7-day forecasts related to droughts, floods, or other critical climate events in key agricultural countries.
- The system serves as a **proactive decision-support tool**, offering early warnings to help mitigate the risk of food insecurity, monitor potential crop disruptions, and guide national or global-level interventions.
- By bridging **AI, meteorological data**, and global food supply analytics, the system enhances resilience and readiness across the agricultural ecosystem‚Äîespecially in response to **climate volatility and structural fragilities** in food production.

## ü§ñ üåæOutcomes:

- Successfully developed an **Advanced Data Science and AI-Powered Food Supply Prediction and Semantic Search Engine**, leveraging LLM-based RAG architecture with API integration to enable intelligent, context-aware retrieval of agricultural insights across countries.
- Deployed a **Mini Agentic AI System** that proactively delivers automated weather alerts via email to key stakeholders in food security organizations‚Äîproviding early warnings on drought or extreme rainfall conditions, reducing uncertainty, and enhancing decision-making to safeguard global food systems and human well-being.

## **üìù Key Insights & Findings:**

- **High-quality data inputs yield superior outcomes.** The quality of initial data significantly influences the effectiveness of predictive and generative models.
- **Global Food Powerhouses Identified:** Many countries‚Äîsuch as **China, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia** (Asia); **Albania, Armenia, Poland** (Europe); **Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa, Morocco** (Africa); **USA, Canada** (North America); and **Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Chile** (Latin America)‚Äîemerge as major contributors to the global food supply, acting as the world‚Äôs "kitchens."
- **Climate change and natural disasters** (e.g., floods, droughts) have a **clear inverse impact** on agricultural productivity, reaffirming the urgency of climate resilience in food systems.
- **Quantitative data** supports strong storytelling at scale, but **LLM-based analysis** (e.g., from **TripAdvisor reviews** or **X/Twitter feeds**) unlocks deeper consumer and sentiment insights‚Äîproving highly effective for unstructured data.
- **NLP performance scales with input volume**: The larger the corpus, the better the pre-training outcomes. **GPT-2 performed competitively**, often matching or surpassing **Bigram NLP models**.
- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) is useful for **word similarity and clustering**, though it may lack the precision of transformer-based models.
- **RAG with API Integration (Model B)** achieved **zero hallucination and high precision** in semantic search‚Äîvastly outperforming traditional plain search (Model A). This underlines the importance of **Responsible AI** in preventing misinformation and promoting reliability.

## **üèõÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏èAddressing Ethical Risks & Mitigating AI Hallucinations**

- ‚úÖ **Constrain AI Responses to Verified Sources**: Ensure all AI-generated outputs‚Äîespecially in semantic search‚Äîare grounded strictly in **retrieved embeddings or chunked content**, not external hallucinations or speculative answers.
- üîê **Prompt Design for Data Privacy Compliance**: Implement **clear and constrained prompts** in Agentic AI workflows to **avoid unintended outreach** (e.g., emails sent to unauthorized or unrelated recipients), especially when issuing alerts about sensitive topics like extreme weather or food shortages.
- üìç **Context-Aware Filtering**: Integrate logic filters and IF-nodes to confirm recipient relevance and authority before executing automated communications‚Äî**preventing public misinformation or panic.**

**Prompts with Ethical concerns for Automated sending email.**

STEPS

1. Retrieve Weather Condition and Countries' Food Production information
2. combine weather Condition with Food Product information
3. Analyze those information
4. Create the weather forecasting alert message to Head of Food Security Organization and alert he/she about weather condition that might cause heavy rain, or droughts and negative impact on Yields and Humanity
5. Send the message via Send_Mail

TOOLS

Send_Mail: this too allows sending emails.

CONSTRAINS

You must send email about weather to Head who is monitoring Global Food Supply Chains and send Alert.

## **üöÄ Conclusion:**

## **Data Science Meets Applied AI for Real-World Innovation**

This project exemplifies how advanced Data Science techniques integrated with Applied AI tools can drive innovative, impactful outcomes. From predictive modeling to semantic search and Agentic AI automation, each component demonstrates the power of transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.

**The journey shows that:**

- Data Science provides the analytical foundation to understand trends, patterns, and signals.
- Applied AI scales those insights into automated decisions, smart alerts, and interactive intelligence.
- When fused with ethical design and clear prompts, AI becomes a powerful enabler-not just for automation, but for meaningful, mission-driven change in industries like agriculture, finance, and public safety.

Ultimately, innovation lies not just in the technology itself, but in how we responsibly apply it to solve global challenges with precision, clarity, and purpose.
